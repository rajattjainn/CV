This repository contains various ML models for [Titanic Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)

I hope to solve the above challenge with various ML models in order to get familiar with them.

I am hoping to cover the following topics:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Logistic Regression while tuning hyper-parameters
3. Classic CNN
4. ResNets
5. Inception
6. MobileNet

I am going to use PyTorch framework for the above.
