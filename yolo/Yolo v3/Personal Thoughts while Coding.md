**Fear**: The presence of fear can be felt so profoundly. I wasn't able to work yesterday due to some personal engagements. And now when I am back today, I almost feel paralysed by laziness and fear. Today laziness has been driven into existence by fear - the fear of failing at writing the code correctly. I know that I like things start working the first time I try - whatever thing that might be. And when at the subconscious level I know that I might not be able to create the perfect thing first time I try, I fear starting with that task in the first place. Then laziness creeps in and entices me with some kind of instant gratification. It's this combination of laziness and fear that is stopping me from writing *create_module_list* function in *neural_ney.py* file.

One of the ways to fight fear is to logically dissect the genesis and the path of the feeling. You run away from that process as well because it's uncomfortable. But without doing that, it's impossible to overcome the feeling on your terms. I hope the writing the above paragraph has given me the courage and will to look my fear of failing in the eye and not run away from it.
